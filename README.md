# Multi omics tools and pappers
Personal repository to keep track of important pappers in the area of multi-omics data integration (with a focus on applications to precision medicine and cancer genomics).

The common thread among the methods and pappers listed here is that the same samples are measured across different assays. 

Contributions are always welcome.
